The updated decor gives the restaurant even more appeal, as does the culinary style and philosophy showcased on three tasting menus: “Io e Silva”, which includes decidedly imaginative dishes (such as cooked and raw shellfish with a dash of soya and peppers) and is dedicated to his wife; “Io e Giorgio”, dedicated to his mentor and former restaurant owner, which features more classic recipes; and, last but not least, the completely vegetarian “L'Essenza”. Special mention must be made of the wine list, which includes an extensive selection of French labels, of which both the sommelier and Giancarlo are huge fans. As a final attraction, make sure you find time to visit the Roman ruins in the basement. We also highly recommend booking the chef's table where you can dine as a couple yet at the same time enjoy the company of the skilled chefs whom you’ll observe working together like the well-practised members of an orchestra – an extraordinary sight!"

The cuisine is presented on three tasting menus (Classico, Max and Raf), with the option of reducing the number of courses and choosing dishes from different menus, almost à la carte style. With its combination of familiar flavours and imaginative twists, Max’s cuisine celebrates the restaurant’s signature dishes such as the “passi d’oro” 2.0 risotto and the famous cuttlefish cappuccino in black ink, as well as creative dishes inspired by the passing seasons. The restaurant also has its own delicatessen for anyone keen to purchase a gourmet souvenir."

The strength and originality of Uliassi’s cuisine lies in his ability to make good use of local ingredients, taking inspiration from the culinary traditions that have been so familiar and successful along this coastline over the past few decades and giving them a personal, creative twist. Fish and seafood obviously take pride of place, although there’s also room on the menu for meat, inspired by the Marche’s traditional game dishes – the delicious skewered pigeon is cooked to perfection! The colourful dining experience here is enhanced by the owner’s warm welcome, with Mauro’s sister Catia and his son Filippo working alongside the chef. It’s also worth mentioning that the restaurant has a keen focus on the environment, hence its banning of the use of plastic and doing its utmost to persuade its fish suppliers not to use polystyrene to transport their fish."

It’s worth coming here simply to experience the service, an impeccable waltz directed by Alessandro Tomberli, one of the best maître-d’s in Italy. Annie Féolde, one of the restaurant’s icons, left the reins to the highly talented chef Riccardo Monco, who continues to nurture and satisfy the Italian appetite for fine cuisine.

Although this chef originally from Vico Equense in Campania takes inspiration from all over Italy and further afield, it is the passion, colour and intense flavours of his native region that shine through in all his dishes. The two tasting menus, as well as the concise à la carte, showcase elegant dishes full of goodness where the focus is on fish and seafood (although meat also features).

From this, he decided to branch out and open a pizzeria “four steps from the sea” (hence the name Quattro Passi), which over the years his son Antonio and now his grandson Fabrizio have transformed into a temple to Mediterranean cuisine. Flavours, strong technique and quality ingredients combine to create an exciting feast for the tastebuds which finishes with a selection of small chocolate eggs with unusual flavours such as roquefort, rocket, chilli pepper and lemon. A host of different influences (the sea, the Sannio region, France, Japan) and ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, Amalfi lemons) come together in Fabrizio’s cuisine, resulting in dishes that are simple, delicious and full of flavour.

This long gourmet feast features surprise meat and fish dishes as well as an abundant use of vegetables, showcasing technical flourishes that are especially evident in the finger-food appetisers, resulting in a top-quality fine-dining experience.
